                MustDeliver's app automatically keeps the shipper informed of your load's progress so you don’t have
                to. The following outlines the steps a driver needs to take to ensure load tracking is on and the
                load is completed with minimal distractions.

                The MustDeliver app's location permission setting on your mobile device must be set to "Always". This
                ensures tracking updates continue even when the app is running in the background (i.e., app is open
                but not visible). You should open the MustDeliver app before leaving for pick and leave it running
                through the completion of the load.
