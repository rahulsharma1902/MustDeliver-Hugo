        - para: "Picture a well-oiled machine: each component functioning in sync with the others and governed by a skilled operator. Now, reflect on how the operator, in spite of their expertise, depends greatly on the ability to choose the right component for each task, to generate an efficient outcome. This is the embodiment of a marketplace within an optimized logistics platform."
        - para : "In the context of the auto haul industry, the marketplace is a hub where transporters and customers meet. It's a bustling, dynamic, liquid environment where connections are made: customer post loads, transporters book loads and ultimately business is conducted and vehicles are hauled. However, it's not enough to simply have a marketplace - it needs to operate as an optimized logistics platform"
