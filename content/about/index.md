ourPurposePara: "Our story begins in the harsh terrains of Northern Maine, amidst the gritty trucking communities
                that form the backbone of America's industry. MustDeliver is the brainchild of a leader who's lived
                the trucking life. Our co-founder and CEO, Carrie Love, is the youngest sibling in a family of
                eleven. As a child, she rode along in potato trucks, logging trucks, and even the occasional dump
                truck, absorbing the life of a trucker at its core."
