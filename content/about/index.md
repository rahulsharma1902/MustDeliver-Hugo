## Our Purpose

MustDeliver was created to disrupt the traditional freight broker model by focusing on transparency, accountability, and communication.

Our mission is to maintain a fluid partnership that respects and nurtures the human side of the shipping experience.

Our daily work is focused on being responsive to feedback and ensuring drivers feel valued and rewarded for what matters most: delivering exceptional service for shippers.

Our proprietary technology is designed to optimize both the Carrier's access and time. In turn, providing MustDeliver's customers real transparency into every part of their supply chain allows them to make better decisions each day.

The lack of transparency between Shippers, Carriers, and Freight Brokers leads directly to service failures and high levels of distrust resulting in dissatisfaction, especially between Shippers and Transportation Providers.
